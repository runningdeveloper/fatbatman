We took a train from Johannesburg to Cape Town, and made games on it. It was fun hot and challenging. 

I used the face-api library to make a simple wall making thing. Not amazing but I got something to show yay!

There is a great video about the experience [https://youtu.be/hcPeKP9xQrE](https://youtu.be/hcPeKP9xQrE)
