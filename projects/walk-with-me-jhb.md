This was a great project to get involved in, making games in African cities.

There is a hell of a lot of work that went into the greater project from everyone (see details here: [https://www.goethe.de/prj/eaf/en/index.html](https://www.goethe.de/prj/eaf/en/index.html)) 

This was our small part from Johannesburg, a podcast series that we hosted on online.

Props goes to the rest of the team I helped where I could and hosted the website for JHB.
