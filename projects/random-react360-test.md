This was a quick and dirty test to see how React 360 works. I wanted to see how hard it was to do some basic interactions in VR.

I only tried this on a cardboard with my phone.

I would classify this as junk. Please don't reference or use I just needed to see what React 360 was like to use.

Hopefully more experiments to come
