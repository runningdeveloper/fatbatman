It was Hacktoberfest and I wanted a way to help some people. I did it a bit late and didn't really tell anyone so I haven't really looked at it again.

I thought a list of work spaces for people that don't have an offices would be useful. The idea was to crowd source the information through pull requests.

I did get some contributions but this was a bit of a rushed project and then I forgot about it.

Will have to get it working again for November 2020.
